# BC_calc_SSIIM

Routines to calculate boundary conditions for SSIIM2 numerical software even for long-term simulations like different climate scenarios.
Code enables the implementation of different operation strategies in order to calculate the outflow through the turbine or spillway.

## Requirements

The algorithms are written in
Python3 ([get installation instructions](https://hydro-informatics.com/python-basics/pyinstall.html)) and built on the
following external libraries: *numpy*, *pandas*

In addition, the following standard Python libraries are used: *glob*, *os*, *sys*

## Input Data

The below-listed input arguments and data have to be provided to run the algorithm. The input arguments are variables
that can be set in `config.py`.

### WaSim results format

The WaSim results must be in .b16 file format, and must contain the following information, in the following order (each
column):
| Column | Name | Data |
|------- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | YY | Year (int) |
| 2 | MM | Month (int) |
| 3 | DD | Day (int) |
| 4 | HH | Hour (int) |
| 5 | 1 | Inflow (m3/s) - not used |
| 6 | 2 | Inflow (m3/s) for Zalli sub-catchment |
| 7 | 3 | Inflow (m3/s) for Skebices sub-catchment |
| 8 | 4 | Inflow (m3/s) for Holta sub-catchment |
| 9 | 5 | Inflow (m3/s) for Devoll sub-catchment |

### Seasonal water level

The water level is kept close to the target water level given in wl_threshold. The following logic is applied:
| Water level | Mass balance | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `current_wl` < `target_wl` + `target_wl_lower_boundary` | `Turbine` = 0, `Overflow` = 0 | All inflowing water is stored in the reservoir |
| `target_wl` + `target_wl_lower_boundary` < `current_wl` < `target_wl` | `Turbine` = `Inflow` * 0.5 (<=`turbine_capacity`), `Overflow` = 0 | The turbine runs with half of the inflowing discharge, but not more than the turbine output |
| `target_wl` < `current_wl` < `target_wl` + `target_wl_upper_boundary` | `Turbine` = `Inflow` (<=`turbine_capacity`), `Overflow` = 0 | The turbine runs with the inflowing water but at maximum at turbine_capacity |
| `target_wl` + `target_wl_upper_boundary` < `current_wl` < `target_wl_maximum` | `Turbine` = `turbine_capacity`, `Overflow` = 0 | The turbine runs at full capacity (turbine_capacity) |
| `target_wl_maximum` <= `current_wl` | `Turbine` = `turbine_capacity`, `Overflow` = `Inflow` - `Turbine` (>=0) | The turbine runs at full capacity (turbine_capacity) and all excess inflow is released through the spillway |

Important to note: Using seasonal water level with the dynamic logic above combined with a higher `time_interval` will
produce bad results and should therefore not be used. It is only recommended to use `time_interval` = 0 or 1.

### Total sediment yield data format

There must be a .txt file with the soil loss and sediment yield data for each sub-catchment to consider, and the
file name must contain the name of the sub-catchment as stated in the "catchment_order" variable. The .txt file is the
result from the 'Sediment_Loacd_Calculation" codes [https://github.com/KMouris/Sediment_Load_Calculation], where the
first column's name is "Date", and has the date in YYYYMM format, and the column with the totalsediment yield for the
given sub-catchment is found under the columns with name "Total Sediment Yield [ton/month]".
